              "The US government probed the possibility that Adolf Hitler escaped his Berlin bunker in April 30, 1945, declassified documents reveal. 
              The papers, which have been blacked out to protect the identity of officers involved, 
              explore the possibility the Nazi leader made it to South America in a German U-boat two weeks after he reportedly shot himself dead. 
              The files claim Hitler arrived with around 50 others including Eva Braun, his dog and a personal doctor, 
              as part of a pre-arranged deal with Argentinian officials. He had apparently shaved off his moustache and was suffering from asthma and ulcers, 
              but was quickly taken via horseback to a private ranch.  Harry Cooper, who has been researching the rumoured escape for years, 
              says he can document up to 30 years of Hitler's survival after the war. " (Hoare 2018)

              "Between the end of the war in the spring of 1945 and the fall of the USSR in 1991, Soviet authorities put out so many contradictory 
              and self-refuting statements about Hitler’s death that some of it must have been conscious disinformation.
              After initially claiming that Hitler was dead and that they had the remains to prove it, the Soviets then put out word that they didn’t have the body 
              and then accused the British of smuggling Hitler and Braun out of Germany.
              One of the people deposed by the British was an SS general named Walter Schellenberg, who was apprehended after the war in Sweden. According to him, 
              Himmler had poisoned Hitler on his advice. The advantages to telling this story of betraying Hitler were obvious for a former Gestapo general looking 
              to avoid punishment, and since he hadn’t actually been present for many of the meetings he claimed to have led, the Allies dismissed his story."
              (Stockton 2018)


              "The subject of Nazis escaping justice came up from time to time in the decades after the war. Some Nazi diehards, such as SS officer Otto Skorzeny, 
              were known to have set up a “rat line” to smuggle their former comrades out of occupied Europe and (usually) into South America, where friendly 
              governments would shelter them from prosecution. With such prominent individuals as SS leader Adolf Eichmann and infamous concentration camp doctor 
              Josef Mengele making it out of Germany this way, it didn’t seem impossible that their leader had also made it out, thus fueling plenty of Hitler 
              death conspiracy theories." (Stockton 2018)
